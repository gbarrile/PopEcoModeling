# read-in the brown tree snake detection/nondetection data from the islands that we surveyed 
# read-in data from the csv
df <- read.csv("data/BrownTreeSnake_ForestCover.csv")

# how many islands did we survey?
unique(df$Island) # 12

# order the data frame by each island
df <- with(df,df[order(Island),])
head(df, 12)

# 1.
# format detection/nondetection data for unmarked
m <- melt(df,id.var=c("Island","Survey"),measure.var="BTS")
head(m)

y=cast(m, Island ~ Survey)

K <- ncol(y)

C <- as.matrix(y[,2:K])

C # each transect is a row (12 rows)
# each column indicates the survey at each island (six surveys at each island)

# Quick aside, and let's take island 2 as an example. Because we detected brown tree snakes
# at island 2 (during surveys 2, 3, 4, and 6), we assume that brown tree snakes were
# present on island 2 during all the other surveys -- it's just that we did not detect them
# (i.e., brown tree snakes were on island 2 during surveys 1 and 5, we just
# did not detect them during those surveys)

# Also note that detection/nondetection data at each island is sort of 
# analogous to our capture histories when we format our mark-recapture data.
# However, rather than individuals, here we deal with sites



# 2.
# format covariates for occupancy and detection probability
# hypothesized that forest cover influences occupancy
# hypothesized that temperature influences detection probability


# Site covariates versus Observation covariates

# Site covariates do not change during each survey at a given site
# i.e., one value for a site covariate at each island
# e.g., twelve values for forest cover, one value for each island 

# Observation covariates can change during each survey at a given site
# Observation covariate data should match survey data 
# (i.e., matrix of detection/nondetection data)
# We can have a different detection probability for each survey
# e.g., different temperature for each survey.


# Format forest cover as a covariate on occupancy (as a 'site' covariate)
forest <- unique(df[,c("Island","ForestCover")])
forest <- as.matrix(forest[,"ForestCover"])
forest


# Format temperature as a covariate on detection (as an 'observation' covariate)
m<-melt(df,id.var=c("Island","Survey"),measure.var="Temperature")

y=cast(m, Island ~ Survey)

K <- ncol(y)

temp <- as.matrix(y[,2:K])


# remove objects that we don't need
rm(m,y,K)


# Here are the data for analysis:
C      # matrix of survey data (detection/nondetection data of brown tree snakes)
forest # percent forest cover on each island (we think it might influence occupancy)
temp   # temp (Â°C) recorded during every survey (we think it might influence detection)

  obsCovs = list(temp = temp))           # Observation covariates

# p-value here suggests that we fail to reject the null (CANNOT conclude that
# the observed data are statistically different from the expected values)

# if p-value was less than alpha (e.g., 0.05), by contrast, then we would conclude that
# the observed data are statistically different from the expected values (lack of fit)

# in other words, the observed frequency of the brown tree snake site-level
# detection histories agrees reasonably well with that expected under the 
# AIC-best model 'm4'. We therefore conclude that this model is suitable to
# use for inference and to inspect covariate relationships.
